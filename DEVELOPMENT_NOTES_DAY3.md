# Day 3 Implementation: Twitter & SMS Integration

## Overview

This document details the implementation of Day 3 tasks, focusing on Twitter and SMS (Twilio) integration within the distribution system. These integrations allow businesses to distribute their content to multiple channels from a single interface.

## Implementation Details

### Twitter Integration

1. **OAuth Authentication Flow**
   - Created routes at:
     - `/api/credentials/twitter/authorize` - Initiates Twitter OAuth flow
     - `/api/credentials/twitter/callback` - Handles OAuth callback and token exchange
   - Implemented secure token storage with encryption
   - Added state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks

2. **Twitter API Integration**
   - Implemented posting tweets via Twitter API v2
   - Added support for media uploads (images)
   - Implemented error handling for API limits and failures
   - Prepared token refresh functionality

3. **Media Handling**
   - Added functionality to fetch images from URLs
   - Implemented Twitter media upload API calls
   - Added support for attaching media to tweets

### SMS Integration (Twilio)

1. **Twilio Client Setup**
   - Added Twilio SDK dependency
   - Implemented credential management for Twilio
   - Created phone number formatting helper

2. **SMS Sending Features**
   - Implemented batch processing to handle large recipient lists
   - Added delay between batches to avoid rate limits
   - Created comprehensive error handling
   - Added support for tracking message delivery

3. **Twilio-Specific Extensions**
   - Phone number validation and formatting
   - Message tracking with SIDs
   - Success/failure aggregation

## Configuration Requirements

### Twitter Setup

You'll need to:
1. Create a Twitter Developer account
2. Create a Project and App with OAuth 2.0 enabled
3. Configure the app with Read/Write permissions
4. Set the callback URL to match your deployment
5. Add required environment variables:
   ```
   TWITTER_CLIENT_ID=your-twitter-client-id
   TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET=your-twitter-client-secret
   TWITTER_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/credentials/twitter/callback
   ```

### Twilio Setup

You'll need to:
1. Create a Twilio account
2. Purchase a phone number with SMS capabilities
3. Add required environment variables:
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-account-sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+12345678901
   ```

## Testing Instructions

### Twitter Testing

1. Start the backend server and distribution worker:
   ```
   npm run dev:full
   ```

2. Initiate Twitter authentication:
   - Visit `/api/credentials/twitter/authorize?businessId=YOUR_BUSINESS_ID`
   - Authorize the app on Twitter
   - You should be redirected back to the application

3. Test tweet posting:
   - Send a POST request to `/api/distribute` with:
   ```json
   {
     "businessId": "YOUR_BUSINESS_ID",
     "contentId": "YOUR_CONTENT_ID",
     "channels": ["twitter"],
     "text": "Test tweet from the distribution system #testing"
   }
   ```
   - Check logs to confirm tweet posting
   - Verify on Twitter that the tweet appears

4. Test image uploading:
   - Send a POST request with an image URL:
   ```json
   {
     "businessId": "YOUR_BUSINESS_ID",
     "contentId": "YOUR_CONTENT_ID",
     "channels": ["twitter"],
     "text": "Test tweet with image #testing",
     "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
   }
   ```
   - Verify image appears on Twitter

### SMS Testing

1. Save Twilio credentials:
   - Send a POST request to `/api/credentials/twilio`:
   ```json
   {
     "businessId": "YOUR_BUSINESS_ID",
     "accountSid": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID",
     "authToken": "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN",
     "fromNumber": "YOUR_TWILIO_NUMBER"
   }
   ```

2. Test SMS sending:
   - Send a POST request to `/api/distribute`:
   ```json
   {
     "businessId": "YOUR_BUSINESS_ID",
     "contentId": "YOUR_CONTENT_ID",
     "channels": ["sms"],
     "text": "Test SMS from the distribution system",
     "payload": {
       "recipients": ["+12345678901", "+12345678902"]
     }
   }
   ```
   - Check logs to confirm SMS sending
   - Verify SMS received on test devices

## Known Limitations

1. Twitter API has rate limits (e.g., 300 tweets per 3-hour window)
2. Twilio SMS has costs associated with each message
3. Token refresh functionality needs further testing
4. Better validation for media types should be implemented in the future

## Next Steps

Future improvements for both channels could include:
- Webhook receivers for delivery status updates
- Analytics integration for message performance
- Support for Twitter threads and Twilio MMS
- Advanced scheduling capabilities

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure credentials have correct permissions
4. Check rate limits if operations suddenly stop working
5. Verify network connectivity to external APIs
